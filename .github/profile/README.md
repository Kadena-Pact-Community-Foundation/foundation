# Pact Community Organization

Welcome to the Pact Community Organization (PCO)! We're an early-stage, community-driven organization focused on building the foundation for Pact smart contract development through collaboration, education, and open-source contributions.

## Our Current Status

**Important Note**: As of November 2025, PCO is in its early development phase with:
- **1 Active Member**: Organization owner and founder
- **4 Teams Created**: Core-Maintainers, Catalog-Team, Security-WG, Website-Team
- **Infrastructure**: Basic governance framework and documentation established
- **Contract Catalog**: 1 example contract (hello-world) with testing framework

We're building the foundation for a robust Pact ecosystem and welcome contributors to help us grow!
